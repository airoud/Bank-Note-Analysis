In this project, we will classify a banknote as fake or genuine based on the given dataset from UCI machine learning repository which consists of about 1372 rows with 5 columns.

We will be using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Multilayer Perceptron



Data Set Information:

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

Attribute Information:

variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

entropy of image (continuous)

class (integer)



**Can we classify banknote as fake or genuine?**


In this solution, we will be using Jupyter notebook to prepare our solution

It is also assume that you have basic knowledge of python, statistics and machine learning.

Let’s get started!
